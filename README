NotPHP
======

A new scripting language, that takes the good parts of PHP (the shared-nothing 
architecture, the ease of use and deployment for newbies) while throwing away 
all the useless bits (the crappy syntax, the inconsistencies, the lack of a 
formal grammar). Hopefully, if done correctly, we can have a scripting 
language that, like PHP, treats web development as a first-class citizen, 
without all the issues that PHP has.
